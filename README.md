# Web_Game_2
first attempt did not function properly

this is a second try

controls are wasd
"w" = jump
"a" = left
"s" = (not implemented)
"d" = right

sprites = (not implemented) lack of time

clear button clears the scoreboard

reatart button restarts the game but does not clear the score  (not implemented)

files are divided into different folders depending on their type

index.js, index.html, and styles.css are not contained in any folder

js folder contains event listeners and classes

when player reaches the end a popup box should appear with the message "You Win!" (created a bug that stuck player direction to the right)
